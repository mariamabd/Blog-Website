My name is Mariam, and I decided to start this blog because I'm a soccer player.
I've played it competitively for years and I plan to continue in college.
When you are a competitive athlete, you learn to either love it or hate it. If you hate it, you quit.
And if you love it, you devote hours every day, every week, every year, to perfecting your craft.
Which, for soccer players, means fitness. LOTS of fitness.
