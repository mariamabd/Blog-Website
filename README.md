# Blog-Website

This project is a part of the GWC intro to web development series. 
It's a fitness blog to share my experiences as a competitive athlete and help others on their fitness journey!

For the main info, go to blog.html. There you will find the text and code for each link on the nav bar.
The other html files (about, lifestyle, exercise, fewd, contact) are for their designated nav pages.
html.css holds the text design (color, size).
