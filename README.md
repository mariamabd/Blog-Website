# Blog-Website

This project is a part of the GWC intro to web development series. 
It's a fitness blog that I hope to have up and running one day :)

For the main info, go to blog.html. There you will find the text and code for each link on the nav bar.
The other html files (about, lifestyle, exercise, fewd, contact) are for their designated nav pages.
html.css holds the text design (color, size).
